(3) target definition

(3-1) data Definition
	* data size
	　　* int_t: 32bit
	　　* long_t:32bit
	　　* char_t: 8bit
	　　* int_least8_t：8bit
	　　* void *: 32bit
	　　* intptr_t: 32bit

	　　* int64_t,uint64_t,int128_t,uint128_t: no support
	　　* float32_t:support
	　　* double64_t: no support

(3-2) interrupt handling
	* please refer interrupt handing in ARCv2 ISA and core_user.txt
	* number of interrupts
		em4:9
		em4-16cr:8
		em6:10
		em6-gp:10
	* number of interrupt priority: 2
		TOPPERS int priority	ARC int priority
		-1 (TMAX_INTPRI)	1	
		-2 (TMIN_INTPRI)	0
	　
(3-3) CPU exception
	* please refer exception handlidng ARCv2 ISA and core_user.txt

(3-4) timer to measure system performance
	* get_utm is supported
(3-5) extension package
	* mutex supported
	* pri_level supported
	* overrun timer  supported
	* rstr_task supported
	* dcre (to be done)	
(3-6) others
	* other extension

(4) information about system startup and terminating
(5) memory map
	* memmory map of emstart kit
	0x00000000-0x00020000 (EM4, 128K ICCM) / 0x00008000 (EM6, 32K ICCM)
	0x10000000-0x18000000 (EM6, 128MB DDR RAM)
	0x80000000-0x80010000 (EM4, 64K ICCM)
	0xF0000000-0xFFFFFFFF (peeripheral address)
	* linkscript
	when EMSTARTKIT_CPU = EM4_XX defined in Makefile.target, emstartkit_em4.ld will be used
	when EMSTARTKIT_CPU = EM6_XX defined in Makefile.target, emstartkit_em6.ld will be used
      
(6) timer driver information
	* the default period of timer tick: 1ms
	* how to change: modify the definition of TIC_NUME and TIC_DENO in  target_kernel.h	 
	* timer resource
		timer0 of ARC EM is used as system timer (intno is 16, int pri is -2 ). The definition of timer
		is in target_timer.c and target_timer.h
	* to be done :overrun timer support (use timer1) 

(7) serial port driver
	* resources
	  The number of serial port is defined by TNUM_PORT in target_syssvc.h
	  There are two serial ports in emstartkit. Port 0 is connected to PMOD interface.
	  Port 1 is connected to USB-Serail interface, used as default output port.
	* UART parameters
	　　* baud:115200bps
	　　* data bits: 8bit
	　　* parity: none
	　　* stop bits: 1

(8) info about system log
	* the low level output of system log is implemented by PORT1 
	* UART parameters is same as in (6)
(9) building procedures
